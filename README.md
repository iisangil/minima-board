# Minima-Board

Minima-Board is an app that aims to reduce distractions from busy visuals and alerts produced by both the car itself, and carplay. 

For users who find the car dashboard overwhelming, or have trouble focusing on the road when there's an overabundance of information, Minima-Board will give users the freedom to choose what they see.

Minima-Board will give users the ability to:
  1) Toggle alerts on and off
      - Low gas alert
      - High RPM alert
      - Seatbelt alert 
      - Low tire pressure alert
  2) Customize what information they see on the carplay dashboard
      - Emergency quick call button 
      - Rearrange alert icons
  3) Customize the display to their visual preferences
      - Colorblind mode
      - Custom alert colors and color themes
  4) Have multiple saved displays to choose from for different users or needs
      - Select from default display
      - Select from a saved, custom display
